## üéØ Project Overview

**AUTHENTO** is a digital platform for validating academic degrees and certificates. It uses OCR technology, database cross-verification, and blockchain support to detect fake academic documents and provide reliable verification for employers, institutions, and government bodies.

**Problem Statement (SIH ID 25029):** Combat the rising issue of fake academic degrees and certificates by creating a secure, scalable, and intelligent verification system.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **API**: Supabase Edge Functions (TypeScript/Deno)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Deployment**: Supabase Cloud

### Database Schema
- **users**: User management and roles
- **certificates**: Trusted certificate records
- **verificationlogs**: Verification attempt logs
- **blacklist**: Fraudulent user records

## üöÄ Features

### ‚úÖ Completed Backend Features
- **Certificate Verification Engine**: OCR data comparison with database records
- **Bulk Certificate Upload**: Admin endpoint for mass certificate uploads
- **Verification Statistics**: Analytics and reporting dashboard
- **User Management**: Role-based access control (student, employer, admin)
- **Security**: JWT authentication, input validation, rate limiting
- **Logging**: Comprehensive verification attempt tracking

### üîÑ In Progress (Team Tasks)
- **Frontend Development**: React application with Tailwind CSS
- **OCR Integration**: Tesseract.js and Google Vision API
- **Blockchain Features**: Polygon integration with Solidity contracts
- **Mobile App**: Cross-platform mobile application
